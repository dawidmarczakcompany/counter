# Counter App

The Counter App is a basic mobile application built using React Native. It allows users to increment and decrement a counter using two buttons, "Plus" and "Minus." This
README provides information on how to set up, run, and customize the app.

# Getting started

Follow these steps to set up and run the React Native app on your local development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the project's GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

3. **Install Dependencies**: To install the required project dependencies, you should use yarn (or npm if that's your package manager of choice).

```
yarn install
```

4. **Run on Android**: To run the app on an Android emulator or device, use the following command:

```
yarn android
```

5. **Run on iOS**: To run the app on an iOS simulator or device, use the following command:

```
yarn ios
```

# Usage

After following the steps above, the React Native app should be up and running on your chosen platform (Android or iOS). You can now explore and interact with the app as needed.
